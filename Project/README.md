Compiler Construction - Project 
===============================

# Compiler for Mini C to Python
This is a mini compiler for a subset of the C language built as part of our Compiler Construction course (110072).

It has been built as a series of 3 incremental phases, each contributing a key part of the compiler.

| Phase   | Objective                                                                                                                                         |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                     |
| Phase-1 | Select a mini language and finding its specifications |
| Phase-2 | A flex code file (well documented and commented) the takes as input a program in the language we selected in phase 1 and outputs its tokens.      |
| Phase-3 | Write YACC code that uses your code from phase 1 and translates a program written in programming language we chose in phase 1 to python code.     |
