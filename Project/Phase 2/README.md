# Phase 2  
This folder contains 3 files i.e.  
|Files         |
|------------  |
|1-Flex Code   |
|2-Symbol Table|
|3-Tokens      |  

The mechanism through which this program works is that we have called the files "Symbol Table" and "Tokens" which contain the code that we have written, in our "Flex Code" and in turn the "Flex Code" file is giving us output in the term of tokens.  

The video of running code is displayed below:
