## Phase 3  
Write YACC code that uses code from phase 1 and translates a program written in programming language we selected in phase 1 to python code.  

### About YACC  
YACC (yet another compiler-compiler) is an LALR(1) (LookAhead, Left-to-right, Rightmost derivation producer with 1 lookahead token) parser generator. YACC was originally designed for being complemented by Lex.  
Some important points to highlight about YACC are listed below:  
Input: A CFG- file.y  
Output: A parser y.tab.c (yacc)  
* The output file "file.output" contains the parsing tables.  
* The file "file.tab.h" contains declarations.  
* The parser called the yyparse ().
* Parser expects to use a function called yylex () to get tokens.  

### Aproach Used:  
Making a Lexical Analyzer was generally more easy than the Parser at the same time, after reading a lot of documentations and cooperative work, we figured out how to make it happen accurately.  

### Working:  
After download, compile the documents to make an executable, run the executable to parse the source code. There are two methods for giving source code to the executable, we have two methods to set input strings to the executable, first from the standard input in the cl(command line), second from a text file.
The executable would parse the source program and let user know, whether there are any parsing errors in the program.  

### YACC and Flex Compilation  
* lex lexer.l  
* yacc -d parser.y -v  
* gcc -w -g y.tab.c -ly -ll -o semantic_analyser

### (Gcc) Compilation:  
Compile the file of c that has been generated by yacc,t  and that will create the main executable name i-e x.exe on windows and x.out on linux, or we can provide -o flag to oveeride the executable default filename.
