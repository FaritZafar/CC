This assignment consists of 2 Questions and their Solutions i.e. the solution of validating an ISO Email Address and the other validating International Phone Number. Both the questions were solved using Flex Language. The problems that came across while solving these questions were that how to verify an email that can accept charachters,numbers for a username but also we had to make sure that the program validates if the numbers or charachters are before the "@" or after because the program should accept those special characters and numbers before "@" but not after. So we thought about it and came up with a solution to acheive our desired result. Moving on to the question of validating International Phone Number. The problem which arose during solving this question was just to add "+" and count the digits because the International Pakistan Phone Number accepts 12 numbers excluding the "+" for example +92xxxxxxxxxxso we had to make sure that we develop a program that satisfies the mentioned conditions.
